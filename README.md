Planetarium Music Wordpress Soundcloud Player
==============

A SoundCloud Player for Wordpress that is designed to look cool, behave reasonably when the user does not have javascript, and load quickly, even when many players are on a single page.

Currently a work in progress. Right now you can just play/pause the first track of a playlist. And currently it's pretty ugly.

Instructions
---------

The player is added to articles using the shortcode "pmsc". Tell it which playlist to play by adding the "resource" attribute. E.g. to create a player for the playlist with the id "4280637" add the following to an article:
    [pmsc resource="4280637"]
