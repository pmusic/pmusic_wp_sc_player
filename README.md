Planetarium Music Wordpress Soundcloud Player
==============

A SoundCloud Player for Wordpress that is designed to load quickly, look cool, and behave reasonably when the user does not have javascript.


Currently a work in progress. Right now you can just play/pause the first track of a playlist.

Instructions
---------

The player is added to articles using the shortcode "pmsc". Tell it which playlist to play by adding the "resource" attribute. E.g. to create a player for the playlist with the id "4280637" add the following to an article:
    [pmsc resource="4280637"]
